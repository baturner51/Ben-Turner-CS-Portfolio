### About Me
I am a 3rd-year writing major at Loyola University Maryland, currently interested in becoming an author. I love writing fiction. Video games, and movies are my primary sources of inspiration, though, rather than literature. In my free time, I love listening to music.

### Projects

#### Project 1: Week 7 Module 9 Assessment 9 - "What Am I Studying?" (Python)

- For the first project, the research question given was “What am I studying?” To answer this question, I first wrote in pseudocode the specific layout of the intended final product. Next, I created a flowchart to visualize the sequence of coding events. Lastly, I used several Python print statements to display all 5 of my classes this semester, along with my name and the course’s title _(CS 105-02 Making Sense of Data)_. The result of this project taught me the skill of basic Python print statements, as well as a solid understanding of pseudocode and Python flowcharts.
